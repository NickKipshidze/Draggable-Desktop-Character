# Draggable-Desktop-Character
This Python app creates a duck label on your screen that you can drag around. This app was inspired by "rubber duck debugging". The term “rubber duck debugging” can be traced back to a 1999 book by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas called “The Pragmatic Programmer.” In the book, the authors describe a programmer who carries a rubber duck around and debugs their code by explaining it line-by-line, to the duck.
